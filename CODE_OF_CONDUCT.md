We aim to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who wants to contribute to this project. We value participation from individuals of all backgrounds and experiences and are committed to fostering a community based on respect and constructive communication.

## Our Standards

We encourage behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

*   **Being respectful and considerate:** Treat others as you would like to be treated. Be mindful of your words and actions.
*   **Communicating constructively:** Offer feedback and ideas in a helpful and supportive manner. Avoid personal attacks or derogatory language.
*   **Empathizing with others:** Understand that people have different perspectives and experiences. Be open to learning from others.

We discourage behavior that creates a negative environment:

*   **Disrespectful or discriminatory language or actions:** This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments, harassment, or exclusion based on personal characteristics.
*   **Personal attacks or insults:** Focus on the issue, not the person.
