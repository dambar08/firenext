# Contributing to FireNext

Thank you for considering contributing to FireNext! We appreciate your help in making this project better.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing, please follow the setup instructions in our [README.md](README.md) file. This will guide you through setting up the project locally and running it.

## Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes to new features. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow these guidelines:

### Code Style

*   We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code style and consistency. Please ensure your code adheres to the rules defined in our ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.js`).
*   Run the linter before submitting your changes: `npm run lint`

### Commit Messages

*   Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
*   Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
*   Start with a brief summary (50 characters or less) followed by a more detailed explanation if necessary.
*   Example:
```
    feat: Add user authentication

    Implement user login and registration with email and password.
    
```
### Branching

*   Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you are working on.
*   Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`, `fix/broken-link`).
*   Avoid working directly on the `main` branch.

### Pull Requests

1.  Ensure your code passes the linter and any tests (if available).
2.  Submit your pull request to the `main` branch.
3.  Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
4.  In the pull request description, explain the changes you have made, the problem you are solving, and any relevant context.
5.  If your pull request addresses an existing issue, reference the issue number in the description (e.g., "Fixes #123").

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (or if you don't have one yet, state: We follow general community standards of respectful and inclusive behavior).

## Contact

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact the project maintainers at [your-email@example.com] or through [other communication channels, e.g., Discord, Slack].
